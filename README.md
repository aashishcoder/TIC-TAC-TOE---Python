# TIC-TAC-TOE---Python

 

- The board is created using a nested list, which simplifies the code and makes it easier to manage.
-  Functions are created to handle various tasks like printing the board, checking if the board is full, and checking if a player has won.
-  The code uses a constant (SIZE) for the board dimensions, which can be easily adjusted if desired.
-  The code uses a dictionary (PLAYERS) to map player numbers to symbols, which can be easily added to or modified.
-  The code provides clearer error messages when invalid input is detected.
-  The code checks if the board is full, and if so, terminates the game with a "draw" message.


A simple implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the grid. The game ends when one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full and no player has won.
